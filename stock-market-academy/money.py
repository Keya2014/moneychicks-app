        The compound interest formula is used to find the total principal plus accrued interest. 
        It can also solve for principal, rate, or time given the other known values. 
        You can use this equation to set up a compound interest calculator in Excel or other tools.

        **Compound Interest Formula:**

            A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

        Where:

        - **A** = Final amount (principal + accrued interest)
        - **P** = Principal starting amount
        - **r** = Annual nominal interest rate as a decimal
        - **R** = Annual nominal interest rate as a percent (r = R/100)
        - **n** = Number of compounding periods per unit of time
        - **t** = Time in decimal years (e.g., 6 months = 0.5 years; months/12)

        **Notes:**
        - Use the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) as the nominal interest rate r.
        - This formula does **not** account for fees or additional costs associated with loans or investments.

        **APR (Annualised Percentage Rate):** Used for loans to show the base cost of borrowing.

        **EAR (Effective Annual Rate):** Useful for understanding the actual return, but less common in bank rates for loans.
